# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Current Status:

Under development.

## Motivation

Part of my journey learning to create web apps. This part of the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Javascript course. This project in particular has the goal to learn more about factory functions and module pattern and apply this knowledge.

## Development

### To-do:

- [ ] Build the UI;
- [ ] Store the gameboard as an array inside of a Gameboard object. Players are also stored in objects. Use a object to control the flow of the game itself;
- [ ] Set the HTML and write a JavaScript function that will render the contents of the gameboard array to the webpage (for now use just an array manually filled with "X"s and "O"s);
- [ ] Build the functions that allow players to add marks to a specific spot on the board, and then tie it to the DOM, letting players click on the gameboard to place their marker. Donâ€™t forget the logic that keeps players from playing in spots that are already taken!
- [ ] Build the logic that checks for when the game is over! Should check for 3-in-a-row and a tie;
- [ ] Clean up the interface to allow players to put in their names, include a button to start/restart the game and add a display element that congratulates the winning player;
- [ ] Optional - Create an AI so that a player can play against the computer! Start by just getting the computer to make a random legal move. The, make the computer smart - It is possible to create an unbeatable AI using the minimax algorithm.
